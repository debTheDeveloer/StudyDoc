Logging 
LoggerFactory
Logger logger  = LoggerFactory.getLogger(<Class name inside which we are writing this code>);
It comes from SLF4J framework.

Spring Boot Starter web contains Spring-boot-starter-Logging and this starter-logging contains Spring-JCL dependency(Spring common logging bridge).
This SLF4J is an kind of interface. So default implementation of this SLF4J has been given in LogBack classes. This Logback is upgraded version of Log4J.
If we check the jars of Spring boot project built by starter - web, then we will be able to see the jars of LogBack.

There are multiple logging level. e.g: Info, Trace etc.
By default logging level is Info. 
To set the logging level into a different level we have to set the application level logging level.
e.g: logging.level.root = TRACE.
